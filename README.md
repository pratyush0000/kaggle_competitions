# Kaggle Competitions Repository

This repository contains my work on various **Kaggle competitions**, organized in a structured and reproducible way.  
Each competition has its own folder with code, experiments, and documented learnings.

The goal of this repo is not just to submit solutions, but to **learn systematically**, track improvements, and build strong machine learning intuition through real-world problems.

  - Experiments and iterations

- **Scripts** (if applicable)
  - Training pipelines
  - Inference code
  - Utility functions

- **`learnings.md`**
  A running log of:
  - Key concepts learned
  - What worked and what didn’t
  - Mistakes and fixes
  - Competition-specific tricks
  - Generalizable takeaways

- **Competition-specific README**
  - Problem overview
  - Evaluation metric
  - Approach summary
  - Results / leaderboard position

## 🎯 Objectives

- Gain hands-on experience across:
  - Classification
  - Regression
  - NLP
  - LLM-based tasks
- Practice clean experimentation and reproducibility
- Build intuition for:
  - Feature engineering
  - Model selection
  - Evaluation metrics
  - Overfitting and generalization
- Maintain a **learning-first mindset**, not just leaderboard chasing

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

Depending on the competition, this repository may use:

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- Hugging Face Transformers
- XGBoost / LightGBM / CatBoost

## 📈 Progress Tracking

Competitions are added incrementally as I participate.  
Earlier projects may be simpler, while later ones reflect improved practices and deeper understanding.

---

## 📜 Notes

- Large datasets are **not uploaded** to GitHub.
- This repository is for **learning and experimentation purposes**.
- Older solutions may be revisited and improved as my understanding grows.
