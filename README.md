# Kaggle Competitions Repository

This repository tracks my progress across multiple **Kaggle competitions**.  
The focus is on **iterative improvement** — building distinct model versions, documenting research and insights, and tracking submission performance over time.

## 📌 Folder Details

### 📚 `learnings/`
Acts as a knowledge base for each competition.
- Research papers, blog posts, and external references
- Personal notes and strategy ideas
- Domain-specific insights gathered during exploration

---

### 🤖 `models/`
Contains **iterative versions** of model implementations.
- `model_v1_baseline/` — simple baseline to establish a benchmark
- `model_v2_feature_eng/` — improved features and tuning
- `model_v3_ensemble/` — advanced or ensemble-based approaches

Each model folder typically contains the notebook or scripts used to train that version.

---

### 📤 `submissions/`
Stores submission files generated by each model.
- CSVs formatted strictly according to Kaggle requirements
- Naming reflects the model version used to generate the submission

---

### 📄 `README.md` (per competition)
Includes:
- Problem summary
- Evaluation metric
- Modeling approach
- Key results and leaderboard performance
- Notes on what worked and what didn’t

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. Study the problem and gather references → `learnings/`
2. Build a baseline model → `models/model_v1_baseline/`
3. Generate submission → `submissions/`
4. Iterate with improvements → new model versions
5. Document insights for future reuse

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Datasets are not uploaded**  
  The `data/` folder is local-only and excluded via `.gitignore`.

- **Large model files** (checkpoints, weights) are not tracked to keep the repo lightweight.

- Older competitions may be revisited and improved as understanding deepens.

This repository is intended to reflect **learning progression and experimentation discipline**, not just final leaderboard positions.
